# Housing Forecast: Real Estate Predictive Analytics-Python

<h3>Project Title: Predictive Analysis of Apartment Rentals in Chicago </h3>

<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p>This project focuses on the in-depth analysis of apartment rental data specific to Chicago's 60607 zip code. Data was primarily sourced from two prominent websites: Zillow and Apartments.com. 
  
Leveraged web scraping techniques to extract apartment details, including attributes like address, rent amount, total area, transit score, and more.

Applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to predict apartment rent based on various influencing factors.
